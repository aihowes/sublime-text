# Welcome to My Sublime Text Setup
It uses the Desert colour scheme I helped adapt to be used on Sublime Text. In here you'll also find a re-make of the ever so popular Material Theme to match up colours with the Desert colour scheme I'm using.

## How To Use It
I've included two shell scripts to be used to sync sublime text folders to and from this Repo.

To sync folders/files to this Repo from your Sublime Text folders run:
```
# cd into this Repo
$ sh get-updates.sh
```

To sync folders/files from this Repo to your Sublime Text folders run:
```
# cd into this Repo
$ sh bootstrap.sh
````
